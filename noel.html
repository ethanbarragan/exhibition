<p style="text-indent: 75px">I created a layered portrait of my interview subject, Maricela Barragan, my mom, using Adobe Photoshop. She is 43 years old and has encountered many life experiences that have helped define the person she is today. 
<p style="text-indent: 75px">My layered portrait captures a glimpse of her life’s accomplishments in only 25 images. I chose images that would visually represent the early childhood life leading up to the present day interests and career as an adult of Maricela Barragan. First, I chose images of cities in California that my mom had previously lived in and traveled too. These include, Downtown Los Angeles, Venice, Canyon Country, Lennox, Inglewood, and Hawthorne. Second, I selected photos of family: me, my brother, my sister, and pet dog. Third, I chose images of my mom’s hobbies and interests. These consist of reading, writing, cooking, running, kickboxing, and and horseback riding. In summary, I selected images, both from the internet and personal photo albums, that embody my mom and who she is.
In deciding on how to design my layered portrait of my interview subject, I took into consideration placing my images according to my background, the Loyola Marymount University (LMU) campus, and scaling my images of importance. For example, I situated some images along the walkway and light pole of the camps. Additionally, another examples is, I purposely sized images that were goals or accomplishments, achieved by my mom, much bigger than images of hobbies and interests. 
<p style="text-indent: 75px">In conclusion, integrating my images to the background and scaling them based on importance was key in the layout and final product of my layered portrait of my mom. As you can see, after interviewing and creating a layered portrait of Maricela Barragan, my mom, I learned about her everlasting life experiences and her steps to her journey into the profession she sought in order to help others.</p></center>

				<h2><center>How can we as researchers use qualitative information, such as an interview with a family member, as data?</h2>
				<h3><center>I recorded my interview, using my smartphone or another recording device. I then transcribed my interview from the audio file, and typed it out as an audio file. After, I made another copy of the interview, annotating and (color) coding the data that I found, with the generative codes. Lastly, I used a map of the world to match specific locations noted in your interview.</center></h3>
